<p><strong>What is Pubstars?</strong></p>

<p>Pubstars league is a modded server running a ranked game mode for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hockeyquestionmark/">Hockey?</a>, a game by <a href="https://twitter.com/crypticsea">@@crypticsea</a>. The ranking system uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">Microsoft's TrueSkill</a>, which is also used on Xbox Live for matchmaking. The server will calculate rankings and record player stats after every game and use those rankings to create teams for the next game. </p>

<br />

<p><strong>How can I play?</strong></p>

<p>Sign up in with steam in the upper right hand corner.</p>

<p>Join the PubStars League server and login by typing</p>

<pre><code>/join mypassword
</code></pre>

<p>You might have to wait a bit if you just created an account. They have to be manually approved by an Admin. </p>

<p>Note: <em>You have to type this command in the warmup period before every game. This is to prevent AFK people being selected for a team.</em></p>

<br />

<p><strong>Why won't a game start?</strong></p>

<p>There is a required minimum number of players to start a game. When there are enough players logged in the server will create teams and drop everyone in. You can type</p>
    <pre><code>/info
</code></pre>  
<p>to see how many players are logged in and how many the game needs to start.</p>

<br />

<p><strong>How can I help?</strong></p>

<p>You can donate to the server directly to help offset the cost of running it. <a href="https://www.nfoservers.com/donate.pl?force_recipient=1&recipient=pubstarsreports%40gmail.com">Donate here.</a> </p>
